// Any changes to this file will be discarded for grading.
// Typically, the MMU is implemented in hardware, so there is a specific page table format that cannot be changed.
// When the user process wants to read or write to a page, the MMU will do the following:
// 1. If the page of interest does not have 'valid' bit set, the MMU will raise SIGUSR1 to your OS, and block until you raise SIGCONT to the MMU.
// 2. Otherwise, the MMU will set 'referenced' bit.  If the user process is writing to the page, the MMU will additionally set 'dirty' bit.
// 3. The MMU will use the 'frame_index' specified to read/write data to that frame in RAM, as directed by the user process.

#define FRAME_BITS 2
#define PAGE_BITS 10

    unsigned referenced : 1; // will be set by the MMU when the user program reads or writes to this page
    unsigned dirty : 1; // will be set by the MMU when the user program writes to this page
